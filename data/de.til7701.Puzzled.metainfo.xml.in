        <p>
            Inspired by Puzzle a Day, this application provides more variants and a
            solver to aid in your puzzling endeavours.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can drag the tiles with your mouse, rotate them with right-click, and
            flip them with middle, click. Move the tiles to fill the board in the
            middle to solve the puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can get hints to see whether or not you can
            solve the puzzle with the tiles currently placed on the board.

                        Instead of getting solvability-feedback every time you move a tile, you now have to request a
                        hint. This hint either shows a transparent tile where one should be placed or tells you that the
                        puzzle cannot be solved with the current approach.

                    a layout with a two-digit year. Potential errors are highlighted
                    and a solver predicts the solvability of the current approach.
